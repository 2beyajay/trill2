            <h1>About Trill</h1>
            <h2>A last.fm based applicaiton</h2>

            <p>
                With Trill, anyone can visualize their music listening habits as well as download a collage custom made from thier most listened albums. It has visual graphs which show the user what track, artist, or album they most spent time with over the selected period of time.
            </p>

            <p>Trill is totally responsive for all screen sizes but you need to have a tablet or a desktop view open if you wish to utilize the collage making feature.</p>

            <h2>Personal note</h2>
            
            <p>
                This is by far my most passion dripping project where I learned a lot in terms of back-end as well as front-end web development. 
            </p>

            <p>
                I initially started to develop a node driven Trill with no-sql database(MongoDB). But soon I realized that it was overkill. Hence, I switched to an applicaiton which is completely run on client's device.
            </p>

            <p>
                I had a lot of fun in the design and thought process, including the logo designing. I had to pivot and shimmy a lot over the course of developmenet. But that's how I leanred so much and I'm glad I made mistakes that I eventually fixed myself. I also look forward to running into more problems in future because you <span>never stop learning</span>.
            </p>

            <p>Have a wonderful day.. night? ðŸ˜•</p>
